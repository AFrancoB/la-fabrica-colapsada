        On September 19th,1985, an earthquake of 8.1 degrees on the Richter
        scale shook Mexico City for 120 seconds. The aftermath was overwhelming:
        412 buildings collapsed and 5728 were significantly damaged. The death
        count remains uncertain: according to the Mexican Secretary for National
        Defence, 2000 people died in the earthquake; the National Health
        Institute claims these numbers are more likely between 3000 and 6000,
        whereas some journalists count over 20,000 fatalities. The Mexican State
        was surpassed by the magnitude of the tragedy yet rejected help
        (intervention) from the international community - except a new IMF loan,
        of course. The inability of the government to act in the aftermath of
        the earthquake activated a network of solidarity among citizens that
        became the basis for a civil society and would become key for future
        political changes in the city and the country as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around 1pm on the 19th of September, in 2017, two hours after the
        ceremonial simulacrum that commemorates the 1985 earthquake (19-S I), an
        earthquake of less intensity (7.1 degrees Richter) but with an epicentre
        closer to the capital of the country shook Mexico City's people again.
        Around 50 buildings collapsed, and more than 300 people lost their
        lives. The earthquake was not as deadly or intense as 19-S I but was
        certainly the most destructive since then. Immediately people turned on
        old radios (since all other forms of communication were down) and
        started gathering around what was perceived to be the most affected
        areas of the city to help: bringing in useful items like first response
        medical equipment; tools for debris removal; water and food for people
        working at the sites. Collectives of bike riders organised to transport
        information and resources from one location to another; hotels
        facilitated rooms for people that lost their homes; architects designed
        manuals for people to check if their homes were in danger of collapsing;
        audio engineers used their equipment to listen to possible survivors
        underneath the debris of some buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly before this all happened, a few days before the earthquake
        struck Mexico City on September 19, 2017, an earthquake with a magnitude
        of 8.2 degrees Richter was registered just before midnight, with an
        epicentre 133 km southwest of Pijijiapan in the state of Chiapas. This
        was the strongest earthquake registered with scientific instruments in
        the history of Mexico. It affected the south of the country with
        fatalities in Oaxaca, Chiapas and Tabasco. The material damage was
        intense and, until today, people are recovering from it. The devastation
        of the earthquake was undermined in Mexico because of the lack of care
        people give to things happening in the south of the country or even
        outside Mexico City.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the 2017 earthquake, on September 19th, other cities and towns
        were also struck catastrophically by the earthquake. Cities like Cholula
        or Cuernavaca had fatalities as well as material losses. Yet the broader
        attention was given to Mexico City.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is not my position to tell the story of these other places. I will
        centre neither my personal experience of the 2017 earthquake nor even
        the story of the buildings that fell in my childhood neighbourhood.
        However, I will tell the stories that make Mexico City (my home town)
        the locus of a class struggle that resonates throughout the world in
        unforeseen ways. Today it can be said that Covid-19 has been a dress
        rehearsal for the 'natural disasters' to come in the 21st Century. In a
        few years from now, we will be struck by more 'natural disasters,' and
        we will have to choose to either stay at home and obey or go out to the
        streets and, through scientific knowledge and emancipatory politics,
        take back the land and labour that is stolen from us by capitalism. The
        stories of Mexico City can be an inspiration to confront fear with
        courage and solidarity and to make many new worlds possible.
